# Feedback App

This is a simple feedback app built with React. It allows users to provide feedback on a product or service by leaving a comment and rating the product or service out of 10. The app uses a mock JSON server backend to store the feedback data. It also shows the total number of reviews and the average rating of the product or service. Users can also add, delete and edit feedback along with their ratings.
